# Use a Weather API
For Authentication Process

### Inspiration
Major League Hacking & Developer Student Community

_Weather APIs are a great way to add a level of automation to your project. Ideas include an alarm clock to tell you the weather in the morning, create an application that picks out your commute based on the weather, or predicts the best days to get outside for a run._

Data needs to be authenticate. So, why don't we use weather API for same?

### What it does?
Check-In whether the user is warm enough for Login!
Basicaly, checks to see if the temperature is above 10 degrees C, and if the user has the right username, it lets them into the next page.

### How we built it
Using a Weather API and JavaScript

### Challenges we ran into
Unable to control the weather, for testing purpose

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works! made a basic copy-able template website.

### What we learned!
APIs can be used for all sorts of fun stuff!

### What's next for Use a Weather API
Looking forward for visualize any other weather proofs!
