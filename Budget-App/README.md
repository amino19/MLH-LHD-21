# Budget App 
Easy-to-use, lightweight and self-hosted solution to track your finances


**Features:**

- **Easy-to-use** - simple and intuitive UI

- **Lightweight** - backend is written in [Go](https://golang.org/), HTML is prepared with [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). Vanilla JavaScript is used just to make frontend interactive. So, JS code is very primitive and lightweight: it won't devour all your CPU and RAM (even with Chrome ðŸ˜‰)

- **Self-hosted** - you don't need to trust any proprietary software to store your financial information

## Install

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (optional)

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` with the following content (you can find more settings in [Configuration](#configuration) section):

    ```yaml
    version: "2.4"
    services:
      budget-manager:
        image: ghcr.io/shoshinnikita/budget-manager:latest
        container_name: budget-manager
        environment:
          DB_TYPE: postgres
          DB_PG_HOST: postgres
          DB_PG_PORT: 5432
          DB_PG_USER: postgres
          DB_PG_PASSWORD: very_strong_password
          DB_PG_DATABASE: postgres
          SERVER_PORT: 8080
          SERVER_CREDENTIALS: your credentials # more info in 'Configuration' section
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
      postgres:
        image: postgres:12-alpine
        container_name: budget-manager_postgres
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: very_strong_password
          POSTGRES_DB: postgres
        volumes:
          # Store data in ./var/pg_data directory
          - type: bind
            source: ./var/pg_data
            target: /var/lib/postgresql/data
        command: -c "log_statement=all"
    ```

2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
3. Go to `http://localhost:8080` (change the port if needed)
4. Profit!
