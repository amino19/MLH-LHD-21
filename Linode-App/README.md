### How we built it
Linode, React-native

### Challenges we ran into
Numerous!

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Ready to go!

### What we learned
Linode API 

### What's next for Deploy an application using Linode

**Running development version**
Development with an android phone works hassle free.

For runnging the web version you'll need https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere for a local API proxy. And switch static.js's const settings object to use window.localStorage as storage backend and apiBaseUrl to use the local API proxy.


## TODO:
