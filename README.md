# MLH LHD 21
- Major League Hacking (MLH) is the official student hackathon league. Each year, we power over 200 weekend-long invention competitions that inspire innovation, cultivate communities and teach computer science skills to more than 65,000 students around the world. MLH is an engaged and passionate maker community, consisting of the next generation of technology leaders and entrepreneurs.

- MLH has been a community first, mission driven organization from the beginning. We measure our success by the number of hackers we empower, and we want to keep it that way. That’s why we made it official and became a Certified B Corporation in 2016. B Corps are for-profit enterprises that are legally required to consider the impact of their decisions on their community, not just their shareholders.

- Local Hack Day is organized by Major League Hacking (MLH). MLH is the official global hacker community.

#### CODE OF CONDUCT?

- We want to make sure that MLH Local Hack Day events create a safe and welcoming environment for attendees and organizers. For this reason the MLH Code of Conduct should be followed throughout the duration of each event.

#### WHAT IS LHD : SHARE?

- Local Hack Day: Share is a week-long celebration of sharing everything you’ve learned as a hacker. If you’ve been hacking with us all year, we’re excited to have you back. If this is your very first event, we’ve got a ton of beginner-friendly challenges for you to complete that’ll have you shipping your hack like a pro in no time. You’ll have your pick of technical, design, and social challenges to complete - each with an emphasis on sharing your work. The more challenges you conquer, the more points you’ll earn. Tune in each day to check out the leaderboards and share what you’ve built.

#### Why do hackers love MLH powered Hackathons?

- MLH is an organization for hackers, by hackers. Whether you're a complete beginner or a returning veteran, you'll feel right at home at MLH powered events.

- We believe that hackers should have access to the latest and greatest technology. That’s why we partner up with the world’s leading brands to get their products and devices into the hands of hackers. At MLH powered Hackathons, students can expect to have access to everything from microcontrollers to free web hosting and domains. Don’t have a laptop? Don’t worry! We probably have one you can hack on for the weekend!
