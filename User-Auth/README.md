Extremely simple installation in a fresh and naked typical Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server:

Download the installer script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panique/huge/master/_one-click-installation/bootstrap.sh
```

Make it executable
```bash
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
```

Run it! Give it some minutes to perform all the tasks. And yes, you can thank me later :)
